   <h3>What is no homo?</h3>
   <p>Have you ever said something to one of your bromigos that you have regreted? 9/10 the thing you said was probably gay. Not that thats
    a bad thing but you don't want to put off the wrong kind of vibe. Now, with the power of nohomo procured by the coolest
   of the cool, the most manly masculine man devleopers Zolon and Munish, you can be the big dawg in the frat house again.
   No longer will you be the beta male, you'll always be the alpha brotienshake man dog.</p>
